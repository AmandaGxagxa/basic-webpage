       Whether it's Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament or Trafalgar Square, London's sights are instantly recognizable.<br> Blessed with a historical grandeur, from the Tower of London to the Inns of Court, the city's past provides ample opportunity for aimless, misty-eyed strolling. Its museums are global big hitters, the brutalist Tate Modern and the National Portrait Gallery showcasing the finest art around. And its royal parks are the ideal spot for spending a sunny afternoon, whether it's boating in Regents Park or taking a swim in Hyde Park's Serpentine. Adventurous visitors can take advantage of London's superb Tube and rail system to explore distant neighborhoods, from leafy Hampstead to hip Hackney.

  <h1>Historic places in Cape Town</h1>

  <div class="place">
  <h2>Church Square</h2>
<img class="church" src="images/church2.jpg" alt="">
Church Square is a multi-layered space in the heart of Cape Town, with a long and complex history. This area of the city is particularly rich in slave history. On one side stands The Groote Kerk, which gives the square its name. Hundreds of years ago, slaves would wait on the square for their Masters as they attended services at the Groote Kerk. It also includes the Slave Lodge, where thousands of slaves were housed, doubling up, for a time, as one of the Cape’s most well-known brothels. It is a place laden with painful memory, but it is also a place with exciting potential as a lively and engaging public space, one which honours and respects this shared history.

  It consisted of the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council. In 1910, the Union of South Africa was established, unifing the Cape Colony, the Natal Colony, the Transvaal Colony and the Orange River Colony. With the unification of South Africa came the establishment of a new parliament, the Parliament of South Africa.In 1961, the Republic of South Africa was established, severing its ties with the United Kingdom. A few significant changes were made later: Coloured representation was ended in 1968, leaving both the Senate and the House of Assembly representing white voters only; the Senate was abolished in 1981, changing Parliament to a unicameral legislature; and South West Africa ceased being represented in Parliament from 1977.
